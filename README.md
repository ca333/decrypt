# Decrypt

Decrypt is a Rust application focused on efficient and secure decryption procedures. Born from a unique collaboration between ca333 (Kadan Stadelmann) and a tweaked version of ChatGPT, Decrypt aims to provide a robust and versatile platform for decryption operations - both in form of a library as well as enduser software.

Current Version: Initial Release (Work in Progress)

As we embark on this journey, please note that the current version of Decrypt is an initial PoC release. It serves as a starting point, showcasing our commitment to building a comprehensive tool tailored for cryptography enthusiasts and professionals alike.

Features

Initial Caesar Cipher Decryption: A simple yet effective implementation of the Caesar cipher decryption algorithm, setting the stage for more complex features.

Coming Soon
Extensive Crypto Stack Coverage: We plan to expand Decrypt to support a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and libraries, encompassing both classical and modern cryptography.

Zero Dependencies Vision: In line with zerodeps.com's philosophy, Decrypt will be developed with a strong emphasis on minimal external dependencies, ensuring a lightweight and efficient application.

Installation & Usage
Instructions for installation and basic usage will be provided here.

Disclaimer
This project is a collaborative effort between @ca333 and a tweaked ChatGPT. Please note that Decrypt is a work in progress, representing only the initial version of what we envision to be a comprehensive cryptographic toolkit. It's not close to being final, and we are committed to evolving and enhancing its capabilities in line with the zerodeps.com vision.
